# Teach-Basics

This repository has long been in my mind as worthwhile venture. I have wanted to give others whatever knowlege I have and as a byproduct develop a better understanding of the field of data science and mathematics as a whole.  I firmly believe that if you can effictively teach someone how something works AND why it works the way it does then you must have strong grasp.  This is not to say that once I have convered a topic that I will have mastered it but rather I both an intuitive and fundamental understanding of how something should be used and what the limitations and best use-cases are for any given idea.  I'll try to arrange each topic in a simliar fashion, though the sequence with which I cover topics won't always appear logically.  This isn't necessairly the best way, but because I'm working on a PhD and I'm currently in a graduate course, I'll need to focus the initial topics around those areas as well as any algorithms or concepts related to my full-time work as a principal data scientist.

I would guess as this goes along I will be making revisions to this and for now I'm keeping it private until I can work out the kinks of how I want this to grow.  

Ultimate Goals:
  1) Connect the dots on some mathimatical and computer science topics that I've taken for granted up to this point or have been to mentally taxed to dive deeper into
  2) Present material in an intuitive way.  I think this really is lacking in mathimatics education.
  3) Develop some skills around teaching, developing plans, and github in general.
  
Initial List:  This is not meant to be an exhaustive list but rather a jumping off point from which many subtopics are possible.  My interests are more on the mathematics side.  However, with my current employment I'm forced to put those concepts into a relevant business terms.  This also means that I need to get better a coding.  I often see R vs. Python.  To be honest I couldn't care less which one gets me the answer, but my current company used python more heavily therefore I will as well.  Mostly because I want this to eventually be available to my company's junior or even experienced data scientists.  Though as I write this really the title of a person shouldn't define their interests.  Just one more reason to make this as useful and engaging as possible.

Mathematics:
  Linear Algebra:   Vectors, Matrices, Scalers, Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
  Calculus: Partial Derivatives, Optimization

Data Science: Meaning, Data Exploration, Data Cleaning

Algorithms: Linear/Lasso/Ridge, Logistic, Support Vector Machines(SVM),  Neural Nets/RNN/CNN,  Deep Learning
